# DIYRobocar

![Alt text](/diyrobocar.jpg?raw=true "DIYRobocar")

DIY toy robo car for Deep Reinforcement Learning implementation. It is my practice implementation of the algorithm. It uses HSP remote control car, Raspberry pi 3 and pixy camera. This is an on-going project.

Ultrasonic sensors are wasteful of GPIO pins. I'm currently ordering TOF laser modules from eBAY which uses I2C. These will replace the ultrasonic modules.
