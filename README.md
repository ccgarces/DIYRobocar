# DIYRobocar

![Alt text](/diyrobocar.jpg?raw=true "DIYRobocar")

DIY robo car is a toy self navigating robot that will be using Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm. It uses HSP remote control car, Raspberry pi 3, piconzero and pixy camera. This is an on-going project. Once the DRL is working, I plan to add respeaker and IR remote modules for voice command using LSTM to turn on/off dumb appliances with remote control.


Ultrasonic sensors are wasteful of GPIO pins. I'm currently ordering TOF laser modules from eBAY which uses I2C. These will replace the ultrasonic modules.
